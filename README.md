# Programming for Engineers  tasks–KAITECH  Program 

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **8 Python programming tasks** developed as part of an engineering course.  
Each task focuses on applying **Python programming concepts** such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures (list, tuple, set, dictionary)
- NumPy & Pandas for data analysis
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Problem-solving in engineering contexts

The repository is organized so each task is placed in its own folder, containing:
- **Source Code (`.py`)**
- **README.md** (task details )
